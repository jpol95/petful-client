                go to the adoption page, you'll be able to see both the cat and the dog that are currently up for adoption. You can 
                then enter your name and click to join the line. You'll be able to see on screen, in real time, where you are 
                in the queue and when you've reached the front. Once you've reached the front, you'll be able to click to adopt
                either the cat, the dog or both. Once you click, you'll receive a confirmation that you have adopted the animal you
                intended to adopt. We appreciate your support, and if you like what you see, you're free to venmo Jesse Pollack a
